# FDF

**FdF (Fil de Fer)** was a challenging project that tested my ability to handle graphical programming and data visualization. The main objective was to create a program that would read a three-dimensional map of a file and render it as a 3D mesh in a window.

The real challenge of this project was divided into two parts:

+ **Mastering the MiniLibX:** First, I had to learn how to use the MiniLibX, a graphic library created in 42. This involved understanding how to initialize a window, handle keyboard and mouse events, and most importantly, how to draw pixels and lines efficiently.

+ **Implement the Isometric Projection:** The most complex part was implementing the isometric projection. Through mathematical formulas, I transformed the coordinates (x, y, z) of each point on the map into 2D coordinates on the screen. This created the illusion of a three-dimensional mesh that could be manipulated, making the project not only a programming exercise but also one of geometry and mathematics.

In essence, **FdF** is a project that combines systems programming with graphical visualization, making it a fundamental and very rewarding learning experience.


## How use it

clone the repo

```bash
  git clone
```

compile the code just to see the map

```bash
  make
```

compile the code just to see the map, make zoom in/out, traslate the map and change colors

```bash
  make bonus
```
